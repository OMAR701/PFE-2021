Hello everyone, this is my first time posting on LinkedIn, I want to share with you my journey during my graduation project. We are a group of three and we have to develop a desktop application that help computer science students to visualize how data structures and graph theory works. Our project supervisor offered us to work with a vector graphics Language named Asymptote, which can help us generate height quality images.
